# OpenDTU Breakout Board

This is a fully comaptible Breakout Board for the [OpenDTU](https://github.com/tbnobody/OpenDTU/) Project. With the opendtu breakout board and the opendtu software, you can read out, control and process Hoymiles inverters. In addition, the current energy yield is shown directly on a display.

This PCB has been designed together with the developers and is fully compatible. New features will of course always be added immediately ;).
